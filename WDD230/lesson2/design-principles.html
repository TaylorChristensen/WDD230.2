                            Scoutium does a great job at integrating Visual Hieratchy into their web page
                            by highlighting the icons in the bright green circles. By doing this ontop of the 
                            existing dark blue backround the icons stand out to the users eye. Another thing
                            they have applied well is the headings that are bolded over the paragraphs next to
                            the icons.

                            Apple has done t again. They applied Hick's Law right off the bat with the two options
                            they provided overlaying the image. They provide the user with two links to continue
                            to other pages; the links are titled "Learn More" and "Buy". This applied Hick's Law
                            becasue they are assuming that the user will want to do one of these two things upon
                            cisiting the first page of the site.

                        The rule of third is displayed by Staak on their desktop web interface in a horizontal plane.
                        This is where they place the main focal point/ object of the image on one of the grid lines that
                        measures the image for use of this rule. On their mobile app they display the use of this rule
                        placing the words in the bottom third of the image while gilling the top two thirds with the
                        image portion of the graphic.
